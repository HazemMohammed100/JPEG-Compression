# JPEG Compression
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a widely used image compression algorithm that effectively reduces the file size of digital images while preserving visual quality. Here's a brief description of the JPEG compression algorithm:

Color Space Conversion: The algorithm begins by converting the image from the RGB color space to the YCbCr color space. Y represents the luminance (brightness) component, while Cb and Cr represent the chrominance (color) components.

Divide into Blocks: The image is divided into small 8x8 pixel blocks, and each block is processed independently.

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): The DCT is applied to each block to transform it from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. This process represents the image data in terms of different frequency components.

Quantization: The DCT coefficients are quantized by dividing them by a quantization matrix. This step effectively reduces the precision of the coefficients. Higher frequency components, which are less perceptually significant, are quantized more aggressively than lower frequency components.

Compression: The quantized coefficients are then compressed using lossless compression techniques like Huffman coding. Huffman coding assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring coefficients and longer codes to less frequent ones, resulting in efficient representation of the data.

Encoding: The compressed data, along with information about the quantization matrix and color space conversion, is encoded into a JPEG file.

To decompress a JPEG file, the reverse steps are followed:

Decoding: The JPEG file is decoded to obtain the compressed data, quantization matrix, and color space conversion information.

Dequantization: The quantized coefficients are multiplied by the quantization matrix to restore the approximate DCT coefficients.

Inverse DCT: The inverse DCT is applied to each block to transform the frequency-domain coefficients back to the spatial domain.

Color Space Conversion: The image is converted back from the YCbCr color space to the RGB color space.

The degree of compression and resulting image quality in JPEG can be controlled by adjusting parameters such as the quantization matrix and the quality factor. Higher compression ratios lead to smaller file sizes but may introduce visible artifacts and loss of fine details in the reconstructed image.
